                The evening class schedule is also perfect for my schedule and offers the style that I am looking for.”</p>

                    <p>Nicole D’Andrea, E-RYT-200, YACEP, is the proud owner and lead teacher of Blackbird Yoga Studio. She graduated from the Garden State Yoga teacher training program in the spring of 2013 under Jody Domerstad and has been teaching wholeheartedly
                        ever since. She came to yoga as a means of reducing stress and tension in her life during college and quickly found so much more. She learned that the regular practice of yoga not only transformed her body, but allowed her to start
                        a conversation with herself that continues to reveal the nature of her soul.</p>
                    <p>Nicole holds a deep love for the human form and is formally educated in movement science and therapeutic exercise. She has worked professionally with the body since 2007 and she is passionate about helping others feel better in their
                        bodies. She has been invited to lead yoga teacher trainings on the anatomy of yoga asana and has been praised for her easy manner and accessible approach to a complex subject.</p>
                    <p>In April of 2014, she completed an advanced training in bhakti yoga at Laughing Lotus NYC during which she learned to merge her two great loves: movement and sound. She often leads kirtans, workshops, and teacher training programs
                        on bhakti and chanting across New York and New Jersey.</p>
                    <p>Nicole is honored to share her knowledge and lead a class that's full of creativity, music, healing, and heart. Follow her whereabouts and learn more about her personal story at <a href="http://nicoledandrea.yoga/">www.nicoledandrea.yoga</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Steve Dessimone</h3>
                    <p>One of Steve’s earliest encounters with these sacred practices came at a very young age. As a child, his favorite movie was the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. In it, there are scenes when the Turtles sit and meditate, and although the
                        movie is full of action and adventure, these scenes captured a deeper part of his attention and curiosity. Seeds were planted, and only when he began practicing meditation almost 20 years later, did he realize that he’d been storing
                        them in the depths of his mind since childhood, and now was the time to cultivate. </p>
                    <p>After a few months of meditation practice, sitting comfortably was, well…not so comfortable. At this time, Steve’s study of eastern philosophy was burgeoning and through this study, he noticed that yoga was also mentioned quite frequently
                        along with meditation. It was clear that this was the next step and before long he began taking classes at Naturally Yoga in Glen Rock, NJ. </p>
                    <p>Since then, he has studied in the traditions of Intergral, Iyengar, and Ashtanga yoga, infusing all three into his personal practice and always keeping meditation as the cornerstone. In 2016, he completed his 200 hour teacher training
                        at Naturally Yoga and considers Veronica Yacco, Neil and Sheryl Edsall, as the springs from which he has been blessed with these teachings. Steve believes that in this life, the body and mind are the instruments with which we’ve
                        been given to perform, and yoga is how we tune them. </p>

                    <p>Kaelyn has been practicing yoga for since 2007 and her love for both the physical and philosophical practice has been a defining element in her life since she first sat in a yoga class. Kaelyn specializes in weaving proper alignment
                        into steady flows with a focus on sequencing. Each class will be challenging, encouraging, and always playful. Yoga has created a space in Kaelyn's life for courageousness, honesty, trust and love both on and off the mat. She received
                        her yoga certification in 2012 from Yoga Mechanics. She has immense gratitude for all of the amazing teachers who have taught her along the way. </p>

                    <h3>Ina Cabrera</h3>
                    <p>When Ina was 18, she attended a free 2 1/2 hour yoga class. At the time she thought it was “super weird” but couldn't believe how good she felt afterward. Ten years later, she began to take prenatal yoga classes to help her through
                        the discomforts she felt during pregnancy. Ten years after that, she signed up for a yoga membership at a local gym, almost on a whim. As she began to notice how significantly yoga was impacted and transformed many areas of her
                        life, her practice became steadier and something she learned to depend on as an anchor. Yoga, along with the support from her teachers and other students, has helped bring healing and self awareness to her life.</p>
                    <p>Ina believes that a focus on alignment and maintaining a feeling of softness allows the breath flow freely through the body to maximize healing. She also incorporates elements from her practice of Tai Chi into her classes. It gives
                        her great joy to be able to share the tools that have helped her through her life journey with others. </p>

                    <h3>Christine Dunn</h3>
                    <p>Christine took her first yoga class in 2011. Although it was challenging, she found a sense of peace and calm each time she stepped onto the mat. I had no idea how transformative it would be for me physically, mentally and spiritually.
                        After committing to a regular practice, I completed my 200 hour teacher training at hOMe Yoga in August of 2016. I have so much gratitude for all of my instructors and fellow teachers that I have met along the way. My hope is to
                        create a supportive and inspiring class, that meets students where they are. I am so happy to share my love of yoga and continue my journey as a teacher.</p>
