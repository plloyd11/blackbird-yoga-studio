            <p>A class designed just for the brand new beginner. In this 45 minute introductory class, students will learn the most foundational yoga postures. Individual attention will be given to ensure proper, safe alignment. The perfect way to begin
              to build a practice and prepare for our more rigorous classes (if you so choose!) Absolutely no yoga experience is required nor expected.</p>

            <p>This class will lay the groundwork for a successful asana practice. It will move at a slower pace to allow students to experience and integrate correct alignment in the postures. Expect to learn poses that will build strength and stamina (basic
              doesn't necessarily mean easy!) increase flexibility, and boost confidence in class. This class is suitable for beginning students or anyone looking to go back to the basics.</p>

            <p>Our signature class. A 90 minute immersive yoga experience. Expect a sweaty, dynamic flow set to music to unlock the body and clear the blocks that keep us from moving, breathing and living as we should. This will be followed by a restorative posture that calms and supports the body and allows it to drop into deep stillness. Practice will be sealed with a closing meditation. You will leave feeling clear, centered, and with a fresh outlook on who you are and how you navigate this life. A Mixed Level/Intermediate practice.</p>

        <p>What can one say about Nicole? Sheâ€™s the real deal. For her there is no on the mat, off the mat; its all yoga; Truly an expert in her craft.</p>
        <p>From her playlists to her sequences, her classes are structured with meticulous care. She embodies integrity and discipline by adhering to the moral and ethical principles of Yoga and possesses a giving heart that shares her skill and knowledge
          with anyone that crosses her path.</p>
        <p>From beginning to end her classes are like mini-retreats, each being a journey into the undercurrent of the subtle and deeper parts of ourselves. And that voice. When Nicole breaks out that harmonium and begins to chant, one can begin to feel
          the beauty of life that is sometimes muted by the daily grind.</p>
        <p>I have personally heard through the grapevine her chanting bringing people to tears (of joy). I wholeheartedly could not recommend her classes more.</p>
