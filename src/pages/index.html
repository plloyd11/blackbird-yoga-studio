                cleanliness, light and joy. The classes are abundant and have something for everyone. Nicole and the rest of her staff are
                professional, caring, intuitive, and extremely knowledgeable. Not only do I take and enjoy classes at Blackbird Yoga Studio, but I
                recommend my patients go there as well. Thanks Nicole, for coming to Haworth and making it a better place because of your amazing
                studio. It's just what our town needed."

                            This class will introduce gentle movement and combine it with breathwork and relaxation techniques. Props like bolsters,
                            blankets, and blocks will be utilized to facilitate ease in each of the postures. Much of the class will be done on the
                            floor. This class is suitable for practitioners looking for a more meditative experience, those who are new to yoga, or
                            students recovering from an injury.

                            This class is designed to move at a slow pace. Yin yoga is a quiet practice in which long-held, relaxed postures help us
                            move into the deeper connective tissues of the body, such as the ligaments, joints, bones, and fascia. This in turn helps
                            guide us to deeper states of awareness to calm the mind, and balance the yang, or more active energies of life. Selected
                            classes will be accompanied with soothing sound, which also help guide the practitioner to calmer, meditative states.

                            experience and integrate correct alignment in the postures. Expect to learn poses that will build strength and stamina
                            (basic doesn't necessarily mean easy!) increase flexibility, and boost confidence in class. This class is suitable for
                            beginning students or anyone looking to go back to the basics.

                            posture that calms and supports the body and allows it to drop into deep stillness. Practice will be sealed with a closing
                            meditation. You will leave feeling clear, centered, and with a fresh outlook on who you are and how you navigate this

                    What can one say about Nicole? She’s the real deal. For her there is no on the mat, off the mat; its all yoga; Truly an expert in
                    her craft.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From her playlists to her sequences, her classes are structured with meticulous care. She embodies integrity and discipline by
                    adhering to the moral and ethical principles of Yoga and possesses a giving heart that shares her skill and knowledge with anyone
                    that crosses her path.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From beginning to end her classes are like mini-retreats, each being a journey into the undercurrent of the subtle and deeper
                    parts of ourselves. And that voice. When Nicole breaks out that harmonium and begins to chant, one can begin to feel the beauty of
                    life that is sometimes muted by the daily grind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have personally heard through the grapevine her chanting bringing people to tears (of joy). I wholeheartedly could not recommend
                    her classes more.
