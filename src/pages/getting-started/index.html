                                We may be biased on the subject, but we believe yoga is for everyone. Studies have shown
                                that a regular practice can not only improve the body’s strength, flexibility, and
                                balance, but can actually reduce blood pressure, improve sleep quality, and decrease
                                stress levels, to name a few benefits. Healthy alignment teaches the body to function
                                the way it should, which can help you out of the type of pain caused by dysfunctional
                                movement patterns and repetitive poor posture. Plus, standing on your hands is a lot of
                                fun.

                                It’s best to start in our Ground, Unwind or Begin classes. Our teachers are experienced
                                with students of all abilities and will always give you 1:1 attention. We recommend
                                setting your mat up in the middle of the room so you can look around at the other
                                students in class and follow their lead. We have everything you need at the studio, and
                                we even offer a special rates to new students: $55 for 21 days of unlimited yoga OR $99
                                for 30 days of unlimited yoga plus a 60 minute customized massage. This way, you can
                                take all of the classes you like and experience different teachers and styles. Once you
                                start to learn the names of the postures, the experience becomes much more natural.

                                We offer something for everyone. Our style incorporates elements of alignment yoga,
                                functional movement, and vinyasa flow; all with an emphasis on mindful breathing.
                                Classes range from very gentle to physically rigorous. Begin classes will introduce
                                proper form and alignment in the postures, and Practice and Bliss classes will generally
                                include a strong dynamic flow. Teachers will always offer modifications for beginning
                                and advanced students, but please choose a class that speaks to your current level of
                                ability. For more information, see our Class Descriptions page or feel free to contact
                                us.

                                Absolutely! If you are feeling intimidated (which is totally normal!) consider starting
                                with our Unwind, Ground or Begin classes. All of our knowledgeable teachers will help
                                you find the pose that’s right for your body. With consistent practice, your flexibility
                                will improve tremendously!

                                Wear clothing that allows you to move freely. Athletic wear or loose-fitting sweats and
                                t-shirts are best. Most women wear athletic pants and tops. Men generally wear athletic
                                shorts (gym shorts or spandex) and t-shirts. Many practitioners bring layers, since your
                                body’s temperature will rise during the active portions of class and fall during final
                                relaxation.

                                We have everything you need. Many practitioners prefer to use their own mats, but we
                                have some at the studio for you to use, free of charge. We provide all of the props
                                (blankets, bolsters, blocks, straps, eye pillows) you may need and offer bottled water
                                too.

                                Please remove your shoes when you enter the studio. Silence your cell phone and leave it
                                with your belongings in one of our cubbies. If you arrive early to class, you are
                                welcome to relax and chat in our lobby, or set your mat up in the practice space and
                                relax. Many students like to unwind or meditate in the minutes before class, so we ask
                                that the practice room remains a quiet space. If you happen to arrive late, that’s okay,
                                but please wait in the lobby until the teacher has finished “om” and the class begins to
                                move. Once that’s happened, quietly set up your mat in an open spot.

                                the daily practitioner. These are our most affordable payment options. We offer flexible
                                tiers with and without massage. You can freeze your account once per year for a minimum
                                of 2 weeks and a maximum of one month. These are auto-debited memberships but there's no
                                minimum commitment, so you can cancel at any time just by sending an email to

                                whether or not you've made a reservation. If there are open spots in class, they will
                                always be open to walk-ins.
