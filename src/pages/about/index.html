            <p>We’re so glad you’ve chosen to start your journey with us. At Blackbird Yoga Studio, we strive to create a space that invites you to practice yoga just as you are. </p>
            <p>We offer a broad range of classes to suit students of all levels of ability: from the brand new beginner to the ultra-advanced practitioner. Our yoga honors tradition. We respect yoga’s ancient roots, but we recognize that you are living a
                modern life in a modern body. Our yoga is creative. We will mix up our class content every single time, but we will always emphasize alignment to keep you safe. Our yoga is functional. If it doesn’t help you move better, breathe better,
                and feel better, it’s not for us.</p>
                <p>We are a body-positive studio. We won’t take your picture or force your pose to look a certain way. That’s because we care much more about how the posture makes you feel, rather than how it looks. Our simple goal is for you to leave the studio
                    feeling better and more empowered in your body than you did when you walked in. </p>
                <p>We believe that yoga is for everyone, and our hope is to provide services that are not cost-prohibitive. We offer affordable membership, as well as discounts to students in school and senior citizens. </p>
                <p>We are an experienced staff with a passion for helping others connect to their bodies, their breath, and to each other. Come home to yourself. </p>

                <p>"I can not praise Nicole and Blackbird Yoga Studio enough. To be honest, I am not very experienced in my own yoga practice. I’ve tried several studios over the last four years, but nothing stuck. In a few classes, Nicole has changed the way I choose to experience yoga. She has a way of making each class personalized. Her personality and methods make me feel relaxed, welcomed, and encouraged. Each time, I grow. Not only in ability, but mentally and emotionally as well. The studio is such a safe space and quickly becoming my own sanctuary. Even if you’ve never taken a single class, I highly recommend this studio."</p>
