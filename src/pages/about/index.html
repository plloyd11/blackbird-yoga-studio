            <div class="columns is-variable is-6">
                <div class="column">
                    <p class="has-margin-bottom-md">We are unapologetically woman-owned and woman-run. We love our guys (and do have a few of them at the studio, promise!)
                    but <span class="has-text-bold">our soul purpose is to transform the women in our community from the inside out.</span></p>

                    <p class="has-margin-bottom-md"><span class="has-text-bold">It's about how it feels.</span> We have classes at every level, because different bodies need different levels of stimulation
                    to experience the exact same thing: rest. Some days, we need to really WORK through our mind-stuff, and on others, we
                    need to land. Ultimately, we're just using the practice of movement to help our students get quiet enough to hear their
                    own intuition, and we’ll do whatever it takes to get them there. And yes, sometimes, that’s a dance party.</p>

                    <p class="has-margin-bottom-md"><span class="has-text-bold">We pride ourselves on giving 1:1 attention.</span> Have you ever been to a yoga studio where you felt like nothing but a
                    number? We have, and that has no place here. Every student will have a high-touch experience (though we will ALWAYS ask
                    before we physically touch you). We’ll learn your name, we’ll understand why you’re here, and we’ll go the extra mile to
                    make your experience the best.</p>

                    <p class="has-margin-bottom-md"><span class="has-text-bold">It’s not all good vibes all the time.</span> It really is okay not to be okay. Yoga teaches us that healing comes when we allow
                    ourselves to experience the fullness of life. We aren’t mental health professionals, but we’re here to help you breathe
                    deeply and slow down. We will hold space for whatever you’re feeling without trying to fix or change it.</p>

                    <p class="has-margin-bottom-md"><span class="has-text-bold">We’re committed to inclusion.</span> We welcome all womxn with open arms. We will never discriminate based on race, age,
                    weight, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Our entire team is actively enrolled in diversity training and is
                    committed to making the wellness industry a more progressive space. Studio Owner Nicole has made a personal commitment
                    to helping people love their bodies as they are, and is a registered HAES practitioner. You are safe here.</p>

                    <p class="has-margin-bottom-md"><span class="has-text-bold">We’re all for small.</span> Not only are we vocal about being a woman-owned, woman-run business, but we're devoted to helping
                    other women in their ventures. All of our merchandise is made by other women, and we're committed to shopping small
                    wherever we can. We also regularly donate to organizations that support up-and-coming female entrepreneurs. We’re
                    serious about helping women claim their power.</p>

                    <p class="has-margin-bottom-md"><span class="has-text-bold">This is about JOY!</span> Seriously, what's a life without it? At the end of the day, we want everyone in our community to feel
                    what it is to fly. We subscribe to the belief that the heart knows exactly what it needs, but too often, the mind gets
                    in the way. Yoga is the practice of clearing out the clutter and revealing your joyful, effervescent truth.</p>

                    <p class="has-margin-bottom-md">We don't take ourselves too seriously, we LIVE for connection with each other, we laugh a lot. We're a real community of
                    people doing our best to get the most we can out of life.</p>
