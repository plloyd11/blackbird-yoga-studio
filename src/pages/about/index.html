            <p>
                At Blackbird Yoga Studio, we help women of every shape and size tame anxiety, release tension and find
                joy in their bodies so they can banish stress, age gracefully and delight in movement once and for all.
                We strive to create a space that invites you to experience stillness exactly as you are.
            </p>

            <p>
                We offer a broad range of classes to suit clients of every fitness level and every movement desire. We
                recognize that some days ask for stillness and others call for a bit of heat. Our yoga is personal. We
                know your name, we know your goals, and we hold you accountable for reaching them. Our yoga is smart. We
                don’t have mirrors in the studio and we don't expect that every body will look the same in every pose.
                Our experienced staff is trained to customize the in-class experience for each client. Our yoga is
                functional. Our practices help you move better, breathe better and feel better in your own skin.
            </p>

            <p>
                We believe that self care takes many forms, so we offer customized therapeutic massage and bodywork in
                tandem with our yoga. We know that stress makes a home in the body and believe in the healing power of
                touch, so we offer a soothing space for you to unwind and receive.
            </p>

            <p>
                We are passionate about helping others connect to their bodies, their breath and our supportive
                community. Come home to yourself.

                    "An excellent, intimate space with nice, knowledgeable and playful instructors that are similar
                    enough to promote a sense of continuity and diverse enough so as not to become monotonous,
                    regardless of the practitioner’s experience level. Neither pretentious, nor aloof – they have eased
                    me into poses that I thought would never be available to me. I have a host of maladies that I
                    thought would keep me on the edge of the yoga community - if I stayed at all. Instead, they have
                    turned my practice from once or twice per week into four or five times per week and most
                    importantly, I always leave feeling physically better and mentally clearer than I did when I walked
                    in – and what’s better than that?"
