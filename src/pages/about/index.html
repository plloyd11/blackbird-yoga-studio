                        At Blackbird Yoga Studio, we help women of every shape and size tame anxiety, release tension
                        and find joy in their bodies so they can banish stress, age gracefully and delight in movement
                        once and for all. We strive to create a space that invites you to experience stillness exactly
                        as you are.
                    </p>
                    <p class="has-margin-bottom-md">
                        We offer a broad range of classes to suit clients of every fitness level and every movement
                        desire. We recognize that some days ask for stillness and others call for a bit of heat. Our
                        yoga is personal. We know your name, we know your goals, and we hold you accountable for
                        reaching them. Our yoga is smart. We donâ€™t have mirrors in the studio and we don't expect that
                        every body will look the same in every pose. Our experienced staff is trained to customize the
                        in-class experience for each client. Our yoga is functional. Our practices help you move better,
                        breathe better and feel better in your own skin.
                    </p>
                    <p class="has-margin-bottom-md">
                        We believe that self care takes many forms, so we offer customized therapeutic massage and
                        bodywork in tandem with our yoga. We know that stress makes a home in the body and believe in
                        the healing power of touch, so we offer a soothing space for you to unwind and receive.
