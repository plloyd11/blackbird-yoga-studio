                    <p class="has-margin-bottom-md">At Blackbird Yoga Studio, every body is welcome. We help women of every shape and size tame anxiety, release tension, and find joy in their bodies to banish stress, age gracefully, and delight in movement once and for all.</p>
                    <p class="has-margin-bottom-md">Our yoga classes meet you where you are. Choose from a comprehensive schedule with classes to suit every fitness level and movement desire. If you want to push yourself with challenging yoga poses and intense movement, we have a class for that. Or if you want to relax and reconnect with your body in restorative yoga classes, we are here for that, too. </p>
                    <p class="has-margin-bottom-md">Our yoga is personal. We know your name, we know your goals, and we hold you accountable for reaching them. Our yoga is smart. We donâ€™t have mirrors in the studio and we don't expect that every body will look the same in every pose. Our yoga is functional. Our practices help you move better, breathe better and feel better in your own skin.</p>
                    <p class="has-margin-bottom-md">Dive deeper into the Blackbird experience with customized therapeutic massage and bodywork. Stress makes a home in the body. Relieve simple aches and unwind from everyday pressure with the healing power of massage therapy. Our dedicated massage space is a soothing oasis where you can take a break from the routine.</p>
                    <p class="has-margin-bottom-md">Visit our <a href="/rates">rates</a> page to see how you can get started. With special yoga plans for beginners, seniors, and students, as well as non-expiring yoga class passes, Blackbird Yoga affirms our goal of making yoga welcoming, accessible, and personal.</p>
